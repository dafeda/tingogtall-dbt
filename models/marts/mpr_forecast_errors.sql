/*
This model analyzes Norges Bank CPI forecast errors to create chart-ready uncertainty bands.
It generates 50% and 70% confidence intervals following Norges Bank's standard presentation.

The model:
1. Calculates historical forecast errors by comparing MPR predictions to actual CPI data
2. Generates error bands based on percentiles of historical forecast errors
3. Applies these bands to the latest forecasts to create uncertainty intervals

Output format is in tidy/long format with columns:
- year_month: forecast target date
- year_month_published: when forecast was published
- forecast_horizon_months: how many months ahead
- series: type of value (forecast, lower_50, upper_50, lower_70, upper_70)
- value: the CPI percentage value
- historical_obs_for_this_horizon: number of historical observations used
