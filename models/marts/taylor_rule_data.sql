This model implements the Taylor Rule as described in John Taylor's seminal 1993 paper 
"Discretion versus policy rules in practice":
https://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Onlinepaperscombinedbyyear/1993/Discretion_versus_Policy_Rules_in_Practice.pdf

The Taylor Rule provides a guideline for setting interest rates based on inflation and 
economic output. However, this implementation uses the output gap as calculated by 
Norges Bank rather than Taylor's original output measure.

Norges Bank output gap estimates: Forecasting properties, reliability and cyclical sensitivity:
https://www.norges-bank.no/aktuelt/publikasjoner/Working-Papers/2020/72020/

Taylor Rule formula: r = p + 0.5*y + 0.5*(p - target) + equilibrium_real_rate
Where:
- r = recommended policy rate
- p = inflation rate
- y = output gap
- target = inflation target (2.0%)
https://www.norges-bank.no/en/topics/Monetary-policy/monetary-policy-strategy/
- equilibrium_real_rate = long-term real interest rate (0.5%)
https://www.norges-bank.no/en/news-events/publications/Staff-Memo/2022/sm-7-2022/
Note that the memo states that the equilibrium real rate ranges between -0.5 and 0.5.
Using 0.5 for now.
